Statistical relational learning (SRL) is a relatively young field artificial intelligence (AI). The field is concerned with reasoning about knowledge expressed as a graph, and tries to solve the core task of open domain question answering. A number of exciting applications can be realised should this problem be addressed, including an evolution of search engines, scientific recommender systems and conversational AI. Link prediction is the preferred SRL technique used for this core task, and most recently has been delivered using latent feature modelling. \newline
Deep learning methods have lead to the development of a number of successful latent feature modelling approaches for link prediction. Performance on traditional benchmark metrics now stands at 95\% and 79\% on WN18 and FB15k respectively. This has been achieved whilst striving to ensure algorithms remain scalable, with the intent of tractability. Performance on more modern datasets has not been as prolific, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) currently stands at 43\% and 25\% on WN18RR and FB15k-237 respectively. This suggests a lot of work remains in latent feature modellling, or alternative avenues of reasoning should be explored.
