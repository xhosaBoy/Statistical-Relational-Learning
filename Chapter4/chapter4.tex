This chapter discusses three hypotheses examined in the thesis, including the application of training algorithm optimisations to recursive neural tensor networks (NTNs), compensating for covariate shift introduced by hypernetworks during convolutional tensor factorisation, and finally the intialisation of entity and relation embeddings using pre-trained word vectors.

\section{Recursive neural tensor networks}

\subsection{Dataset} 

We use the WordNet \unskip ~\citep{miller1995wordnet} and Freebase \unskip ~\citep{bollacker2008freebase} link prediction benchmark datasets.\ WordNet is a lexical database for English, and a taxonomy with hypernym relationships ("is a") and synonym sets. Freebase is a large collaborative knowledge base consisting of data about the world, composed mainly by its community members. It is an online collection of structured data harvested from many sources, including user-submitted wiki contributions. Visualisations of the respective knowledge graphs (KGs), as well as a sample of resource description framework (RDF) triple encoded facts, are presented in Figures 4.1 to 4.4. The WordNet link prediction dataset contains a total of 136,611 triples, and Freebase a total of 375,499 triples. 

\subsection{Baseline training algorithm}
\textbf{Model summary.} Our baseline model for this section is inspired by recursive networks (RCNs). The NTN is a bilinear tensor product between the subject, predicate and object, added to a RCN composition of the subject and object. It computes relational scores between pairs of entities. \par

\noindent \textbf{Contrastive max-margin loss.} The contrastive max-margin loss is used to train the NTN model. A relational score is computed for the target triple containing a subject, predicate and object. A relational score is then computed for the same subject and predicate, along with a non-related entity randomly selected and presented as a corrupt object. Relational scores in the range $ (-1, \; 1) $ are produced for the target and corrupt objects, respectively. The training task is to compute a large value for the target score, and small value for the corrupt score. The computed loss is backpropagated through the network to update model parameters. \par

\noindent We use the TensorFlow framework \unskip~\citep{abadi2016tensorflow} to implement our NTN training algorithms.\ The NTN model introduced by Chen et al. \unskip ~\citep{socher2013reasoning} and reimplemented in TensorFlow by Doss et al. \unskip ~\citep{Doss2015}, serves as the baseline model. We update the baseline's training algorithm by including early stopping, adaptive moment estimation optimisation and hyperparameter random search. We also make use of the same pre-trained word vectors used to initialise entity and relational embeddings.\ The embedding parameters are adjusted during training to generate latent representations specific to a KG. \par

\noindent Summary statistics of the respective KG RDF formalism are presented in Figures 4.5 to 4.7, and Tables 4.1 and 4.6. \par

\noindent For WordNet, it can be seen that predicates are skewed toward "has instance" with $ 43, 312 $ occurrences, and "type of" with $ 36, 659 $ occurrences. Freebase predicates are somewhat more uniform, however four predicates have occurrences under $ 10, 000 $. \par

\noindent WordNet and Freebase subjects are somewhat uniform, although the median number of occurrences is 2 and 5 respectively, with an interquartile range (IQR) of $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ respectively. WordNet object occurrences are somewhat uniform while Freebase object occurrences are skewed, with a single object, "male" occurring $ 59, 663 $ times, representing $15, 88\% $ of facts. This is in comparison to a median object occurrence of $ 3 $ and an IQR of $ 6 $. \par

\noindent The WordNet dataset is split into a training, validation and test sets of $ 110, 362 \; (80.8 \%) $, $ 5, 215 \; (3.8 \%) $ and $ 21, 034 \; (15.4 \%) $ triples respectively.\ And the Freebase dataset is split into a training, validation and test sets of $ 316, 232 \; (84.2 \%) $, $ 11, 815 \; (3.1 \%) $ and $ 47, 452 \; (12.6 \%) $ triples respectively. 


%********************************** %Optimised training algorithm **************************************

\subsection{Optimised training algorithm}

\noindent We update the NTN training algorithm to make use of early stopping \unskip ~\citep{prechelt1998early}, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimiser \citep{kingma2014adam}, and random search for hyperparameter optimisation \citep{bergstra2012random}. The model was trained on a MacBook Pro 2015 with 8 cores, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD, and no GPU acceleration. We evaluate the model by ranking the accuracy scores of the predicted triples for the respective test sets of WordNet and Freebase. \par

\noindent \textbf{Code to reproduce.} In the interest of reproducibility, all code needed to train and test the models in this section can be found at the following links. \newline

Optimised NTN: \url{https://github.com/xhosaBoy/optimised-neural-tensor-network} 

\subsubsection{Results} 

The accuracy results of NTN model trained using the original baseline training algorithm, compared to the optimised training algorithm are presented in Figures 4.8, as well as Table 4.2. The hypothesis outperforms the baseline accuracy across both KGs. It significantly outperforms the baseline on the WordNet KG. Hyperparameter random search seems to be responsible for this improvement, as the hypothesis begins outperforming the baseline from the first epoch. \ All experiments were only able to complete a maximum of $ 12 $ epochs before overwhelming compute resources. The maximum epoch runs are presented in the afore-mentioned figures. \par

%********************************** %HypER and Covariate Shift  **************************************

\section{HypER and HypER+}

\subsection{Datasets} 
We use the following two link prediction benchmark datasets. WN18 \citep{bordes2013translating} is a subset of WordNet, a database containing lexical relations between words. It contains $ 40, 943 $ entities and $ 18 $ relations. FB15k \citep{bordes2013translating} is a subset of Freebase, a large database of facts about the real world. FB15k contains $ 14, 951 $ entities and $ 1, 345 $ relations. Visualisations of the respective KGs, as well as a sample of RDF triple encoded facts, are presented in Figures 4.9 to 4.12.\ The WN18 link prediction dataset contains a total of 151,442 triples, and FB15k a total of 592,213 triples. 

\subsection{Baseline training algorithm}
\textbf{Model summary.} HypER is a model that takes the convolution between a predicate-specific filter and subject vector, generating a subject-predicate feature map. This map is flattened and passed through a nonlinearity, before an inner product is taken with an object vector. The result is a relational score which is passed through a logistic sigmoid to generate a probability of a potential relationship between pairs of entities. \par

\noindent \textbf{Binary cross-entropy loss.} The binary cross-entropy loss is used to train HypER. Like the NTN model, the input consists of a subject-predicate pair, and an object is presented as a target to complete the triple. A relational score is generated for each sample and passed through a logistic sigmoid. Loss is generated by comparing the produced likelihood with the expected likelihood, $ 0 $ or $ 1 $. The sum of losses in a batch of samples is aggregated and backpropagated through the network for parameter update. \par

\noindent \textbf{Benchmark metrics.} The current suite of link prediction benchmark metrics includes Hit@10, Hit@3, Hit@1, Mean Rank, and Mean Reciprocal Rank.\ For these models, all objects in the KG are assigned a probability and then ranked in descending order. The Hit@X metrics comprise the relation prediction accuracy measures of the model, where X describes the lowest rank the predicted object can occupy. For example in Hit@10, only the top 10 objects are considered as accurate. The Mean Rank is the average predicted object rank for Hit@1 after each epoch, for example a Mean Rank of 100 after epoch 1, and Mean rank of 50 after 10 epoch. The Mean Reciprocal Rank is the inverse of the Mean rank. \par

\noindent Here we used the PyTorch framework to develop our model. The HypER model introduced by Bala\u{z}ev\'{i}c et al. \unskip ~\citep{balazevic2019hypernetwork}, serves as a baseline. We apply batch normalisation to the hypernetwork input layer and introduce HypER+. Entity and relational embeddings are randomly initialised during model training. These embeddings are dynamically adjusted during the training process to generate latent representations specific to a KG.

\noindent Summary statistics of the respective KG RDF formalism are presented in Figures 4.13 to 4.16, and Table 4.3.

%********************************** %HypER+  **************************************

\subsection{HypER+}
HypER predicate filter inputs generated by a hypernetwork may suffer from distribution shift during training. We compensate for this covariate shift by introducing batch normalisation for predicate inputs, and call this model HypER+. The model was trained on Google Cloud Platform, on an N1 series instance with  8 CPU cores, 30GB RAM, 512GB SSD and an Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU. We train the respective models for $ 500 $ epoch, and evaluate them using the standard link prediction benchmarks discussed earlier. \par

%********************************** %HypER+ with Pre-Trained Word Embeddings  **************************************

\section{HypER+ with pre-trained word vectors}

\subsection{Baseline training algorithm}
\textbf{Model summary.} We extend HypER+ to make use of pre-trained word vectors from the GloVe \unskip ~\citep{pennington2014glove} language model. This model replaces Xavier initailised entity and relation embeddings with aggregated GloVe embeddings. The model is also trained using the binary cross-entropy loss. \par

\noindent \textbf{Experimental setup.} We use the following benchmark datasets.\ WN18RR is a subset of WN18, created by Dettmers et al. \unskip~\citep{dettmers2018convolutional} by removing the inverse relations from WN18. WN18RR contains $ 40, 943 $ entities and $ 11 $ relations. FB15k-237 was created by Toutanova et al. \unskip~\citep{toutanova2015observed}, noting that the validation and test sets of FB15k and WN18 contain the inverse of many relations present in the training set, making it easy for simple models to do well. FB15k-237 is a subset of FB15k with the inverse relations removed. It contains $ 14, 541 $ entities and $ 237 $ relations. Visualisations of the respective KGs, as well as a sample of RDF triple encoded facts, are presented in Figures 4.28 to 4.31. Property counts for the respective KGs are presented in Tables 4.10 and 4.11. \par.

\noindent For WN18RR, it can be seen that predicates are skewed toward the relations "hypernym" and "derivationally related from", with a maximum of $ 37, 221 $ occurring, and an IQR of $ 5433.5 $ and $ 819 $ respectively. FB15k-237 predicates are skewed toward the film relation. \par

\noindent WN18RR and FB15k-237 subjects are somewhat uniform aside from a small number of high occurring entities, with the median number of occurrences being $ 2 $ and $ 16 $ respectively, and with an IQR of $ 2 $ and $ 20 $ respectively. WN18RR object occurrences are also somewhat uniform, while FB15k-237 object occurrences are skewed, with the "United States" partaking in the highest number of triples. This is in comparison to a median object occurrence of $ 1 $ and $ 10 $, and an IQR of $ 2 $ and $ 16 $ respectively. \par

\noindent The WN18RR dataset is split into a training, validation and test set of $ 86, 835 \; (93.368 \%) $, $ 3, 034 \; (3.262 \%) $ and $ 3, 134\; (3.37 \%) $ triples respectively.\ And the FB15k-237 dataset is split into a training, validation and test set of $ 272, 115 \; (87.746 \%) $, $ 17, 535 \; (5.654 \%) $ and $ 20, 466 \; (6.599 \%) $ triples respectively. \par

\noindent \textbf{Link prediction results.} The cost and suite of current standard link prediction benchmark metrics, including Hit@10, Hit@3, Hit@1, Mean Rank and Mean Reciprocal Rank, are used to compare the HypER+ model without pre-trained embeddings, against the HypER baseline model, as well as against the HypER+ model without pre-trained embeddings, against the HypER+ model with pre-trained embeddings.

It should be note that there is a difference of $ 0.3 \% $ between all three models (HypER, HypER+ and HypER+ with pre-trained word embeddings), suggesting almost identical performance.

This suggested by the HypER+ model's inferior performance to the HypER model. Strangely, this is inconsistent with training and validation set results, where HypER+ consistently outperforms HypER on FB15k-237. Using the quoted HypER test results, as opposed to reimplemented and verified test results may explain this inconsistency. There may be an implementation detail not used by the thesis author to achieve the quoted level of performance.

\section{Summary}

\textbf{NTN with optimised training algorithm.} We attempt to improve the NTN model by applying training algorithm optimisations including early stopping, the Adam optimiser and hyperparameter random search. The results indicate that there are potential performance gains to be realised simply through using training algorithm techniques known to improve performance. In this instance we see an accuracy gain of 6.2\%, across the WordNet and Freebase datasets. \par

\noindent \textbf{HypER+.} We compensate for possible covariate shift introduced by hypernetworks.\ The latent representation distribution drift of relations is pronounced enough that we are able to improve the Hit@1 accuracy of the original HypER model on average by 2.7\%, across the WN18 and FB15k KGs.\ We note graph modelling may be a worthwhile paradigm to explore for link prediction, given R-GCN's SOTA performance for Hit@10 accuracy on the WN18 KG. We also note the greater influence of relational normalisation on prediction performance for larger and more complex KGs. \par

\noindent \textbf{HypER+ with pre-trained word vectors.} Finally we extend HypER+ to make use of pre-trained GloVe word vectors.\ The semantic information inherent in these embeddings significantly improves relation prediction performance on sparse relational data. Their influence is somewhat reduced at higher levels of accuracy, where KG domain alignment becomes more important. Pre-trained word vectors also offer less utility for large and complex KGs, however still contribute an improvement to prediction. The combination of relation normalisation, and entity and relation embedding initialisation using pre-trained word vectors, addresses both the problems of data sparsity, as well as producing higher quality relational latent representations for large and complex datasets. As a result, HypER+ with pre-trained word vectors achieves SOTA performance on almost all standard link prediction benchmark metrics, across both the WN18RR and FB15k-237 KGs.
