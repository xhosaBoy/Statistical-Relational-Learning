% ******************************* Thesis Dedidcation ********************************

\begin{dedication} 

I would like to dedicate this thesis to my loving parents, Duduzile Magangane and Ludumo Magangane, without whom this would not have been possible. They have supported me every step of the way in my education over the past 20 years (or so). They continue to inspire me to reach higher in my quest for knowledge, and I hope this contribution makes them proud. \newline
I would also like to dedicate this thesis to my loving siblings, Yoliswa Musvosvi, Phathiswa Magangane and Phumla Zondo, whose safety and peace are the reason for everything I do. Their never ending energy has fuelled me at many points of giving up, and this contribution is as much theirs as it is mine. I'd also like to dedicate this thesis to my loving second mothers, Busisiwe Zondo and Patricia Zondo. Their warm support always inspires me to strive for the best, helping me achieve more than I ever would of on my own. \newline 
I'd also like to dedicate this thesis to Delphine Pedeboy, a constant source of support during the most trying times of my thesis. Shielding me from obstacles, and tolerating my ramblings. \newline
Finally, I'd like to dedicate this thesis to my late grandmother, Nomaziya Zondo. I've never known a more gentle and wise person. I hope to be more like her every day. \newline
